# Ro
Ro is probably the most simple bot in the world but I guess people can get something from it
The bot is created by three people:
- DominicCM (Original Creator)
- [NathIsEmortal](https://github.com/NathanPenwill/) (Who created [quantumbot](https://github.com/NathanPenwill/quantumbot), and created this readme :o)
- [Deni](https://github.com/Deniernal354) (Who created [CA-Bot](https://github.com/Deniernal354/CA-Bot))
