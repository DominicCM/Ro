# Ro
Ro has been discontinued and is no longer a thing.

Ro is probably the most simple bot in the world but I guess people can get something from it
The bot is created by three people:
- [DominicCM](https://github.com/DominicCM/) (Original Creator)
- [NathIsEmortal](https://github.com/NathanPenwill/) (Who created [Xeno](https://xenodiscord.glitch.me), and created this readme :o)
- [Deni](https://github.com/Deniernal354) (Who created [CA-Bot](https://github.com/Deniernal354/CA-Bot))
